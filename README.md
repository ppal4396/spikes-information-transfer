# Quantitative models of information transfer between neural spike trains

This repository contains the code used in my honours project at USYD, to 
quantify information transfer between neural spike trains.

The dataset we're analysing was published with this paper:

Information transfer is quantified using the information theoretic measure
called 'transfer entropy'. The tool used for estimating transfer entropy
between events in continuous-time was developed in this study:
